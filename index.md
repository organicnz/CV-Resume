I'm a software developer specialising in web technologies and mobile development I have a true passion to create graphic designs. I’m in the earlier stages of my career I have also developed skills in computer applications, hardware and network support and administration. 

Skills and experience that I have received and improved on over the twelve years of my career allow me to organise my work independently and make informed decisions to solve technical problems. I believe that distributing responsibilities among the staff gives more opportunities for fast execution of client orders. 

I’m looking for long-term career opportunities in IT. I have an outgoing personality with leadership potential.
